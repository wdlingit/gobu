Gene Ontology Browsing Utility (hereinafter, GOBU, pronounced as "go-boo") is a browsing and manipulating tool for Post-Pipeline genetic data, especially useful for data with GO annotations. With help of GOBU, we expect biologists and their cooperating technicians can pay less effort on common programming stuff. At the same time, GOBU provides an Extendable Architecture which guarantees the possibility of

1. Arbitrary Data Description,
2. Data Integration, and
3. Extendable User Interface.

This repository is currently for [gobu](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gobu/) at SF. We would setup manual pages here first, and then programs.
